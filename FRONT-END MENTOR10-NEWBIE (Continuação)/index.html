                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun" I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 10 weeks was the best- and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>
